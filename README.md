# Penn State Physics Colloquia Preview Posters

This repo contains a LaTeX class `psuposter` that is used to produce "Preview Posters" for Physics Department Colloquia. Also included in this repo are a template demonstrating usage of the class and the posters produced using the class, each in its own subdirectory.


## Preview Poster
A “preview poster” serves to inform as well as generate interest in an upcoming colloquium talk by including a brief bio of the speaker, their research interests, and links to references for those wanting to read further. Each poster also includes a brief background section aimed at the beginning graduate level.
