  abstract = {The large-N limit of asymptotically flat two-dimensional dilaton gravity coupled to N free matter fields provides a useful toy model for semiclassical black holes and the information paradox. Analyses of the asymptotic information flux as given by the entanglement entropy show that it follows the Hawking curve, indicating that information is destroyed in these models. Recently, motivated by developments in AdS/CFT, a semiclassical island rule for entropy has been proposed. We define and compute the island rule entropy for black hole formation and evaporation in the large-N RST model of dilaton gravity and show that, in contrast, it follows the unitary Page curve. The relation of these two observations, and interesting properties of the dilaton gravity island rule, are discussed.},

  abstract = {It has recently been shown that BMS supertranslation symmetries imply an infinite number of conservation laws for all gravitational theories in asymptotically Minkowskian spacetimes. These laws require black holes to carry a large amount of soft (\$i.e.\$ zero-energy) supertranslation hair. The presence of a Maxwell field similarly implies soft electric hair. This paper gives an explicit description of soft hair in terms of soft gravitons or photons on the black hole horizon, and shows that complete information about their quantum state is stored on a holographic plate at the future boundary of the horizon. Charge conservation is used to give an infinite number of exact relations between the evaporation products of black holes which have different soft hair but are otherwise identical. It is further argued that soft hair which is spatially localized to much less than a Planck length cannot be excited in a physically realizable process, giving an effective number of soft degrees of freedom proportional to the horizon area in Planck units.},

  abstract = {We argue that four-dimensional black hole evaporation inevitably produces an infinite number of soft particles in addition to the thermally distributed `hard' Hawking quanta, and moreover that the soft and hard particles are highly correlated. This raises the possibility that quantum purity is restored by correlations between the hard and soft radiation, while inclusive measurements which omit the soft radiation observe the thermal Hawking spectrum. In theories whose only stable particle is the graviton, conservation laws are used to argue that such correlations are in principle sufficient for the soft gravitons to purify the hard thermal ones.},
