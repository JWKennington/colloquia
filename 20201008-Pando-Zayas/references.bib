  abstract = {We numerically study the topologically twisted index of several three-dimensional supersymmetric field theories on a genus \$g\$ Riemann surface times a circle, \$\textbackslash Sigma\_g\textbackslash times S\^1\$. We show that for a large class of theories with leading term of the order \$N\^\{3/2\}\$, where \$N\$ is generically the rank of the gauge group, there is a universal logarithmic correction of the form \$\textbackslash frac\{g-1\}\{2\} \textbackslash log N\$. We explain how this logarithmic subleading correction can be obtained as a one-loop effect on the dual supergravity theory for magnetically charged, asymptotically AdS\$\_4\textbackslash times M\^7\$ black holes for a large class of Sasaki-Einstein manifolds, \$M\^7\$. The matching of the logarithmic correction relies on a generic cohomological property of \$M\^7\$ and it is independent of the black hole charges. We argue that our supergravity results apply also to rotating, electrically charged asymptotically AdS\$\_4\textbackslash times M\^7\$ black holes. We present explicitly the quiver gauge theories and the gravity side corresponding to \$M\^7=N\^\{0,1,0\}, V\^\{5,2\}\$ and \$Q\^\{1,1,1\}\$.},
