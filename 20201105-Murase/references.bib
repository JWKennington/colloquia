  abstract = {Detection of the IceCube-170922A neutrino coincident with the flaring blazar TXS0506+056, the first and only {$\sim$}3{$\sigma$} high-energy neutrino source association to date, offers a potential breakthrough in our understanding of highenergy cosmic particles and blazar physics. We present a comprehensive analysis of TXS0506+056 during its flaring state, using newly collected Swift, NuSTAR, and X-shooter data with Fermi observations and numerical models to constrain the blazar's particle acceleration processes and multimessenger (electromagnetic (EM) and high-energy neutrino) emissions. Accounting properly for EM cascades in the emission region, we find a physically consistent picture only within a hybrid leptonic scenario, with {$\gamma$}-rays produced by external inverseCompton processes and high-energy neutrinos via a radiatively subdominant hadronic component. We derive robust constraints on the blazar's neutrino and cosmic-ray emissions and demonstrate that, because of cascade effects, the 0.1\textendash 100 keV emissions of TXS0506+056 serve as a better probe of its hadronic acceleration and highenergy neutrino production processes than its GeV\textendash TeV emissions. If the IceCube neutrino association holds, physical conditions in the TXS0506+056 jet must be close to optimal for high-energy neutrino production, and are not favorable for ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray acceleration. Alternatively, the challenges we identify in generating a significant rate of IceCube neutrino detections from TXS0506+056 may disfavor single-zone models, in which {$\gamma$}-rays and high-energy neutrinos are produced in a single emission region. In concert with continued operations of the high-energy neutrino observatories, we advocate regular X-ray monitoring of TXS0506+056 and other blazars in order to test single-zone blazar emission models, clarify the nature and extent of their hadronic acceleration processes, and carry out the most sensitive possible search for additional multimessenger sources.},

  abstract = {Tidal disruption events (TDE) have been considered as cosmic-ray and neutrino sources for a decade. We suggest two classes of new scenarios for high-energy multi-messenger emission from TDEs that do not have to harbor powerful jets. First, we investigate high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray production in the core region of a supermassive black hole. In particular, we show that about 1-100 TeV neutrinos and MeV gamma-rays can efficiently be produced in hot coronae around an accretion disk. We also study the consequences of particle acceleration in radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). Second, we consider possible cosmic-ray acceleration by sub-relativistic disk-driven winds or interactions between tidal streams, and show that subsequent hadronuclear and photohadronic interactions inside the TDE debris lead to GeV-PeV neutrinos and sub-GeV cascade gamma-rays. We demonstrate that these models should be accompanied by soft gamma-rays or hard X-rays as well as optical/UV emission, which can be used for future observational tests. Although this work aims to present models of non-jetted high-energy emission, we discuss the implications of the TDE AT2019dsg that might coincide with the high-energy neutrino IceCube-191001A, by considering the corona, RIAF, hidden sub-relativistic wind, and hidden jet models. It is not yet possible to be conclusive about their physical association and the expected number of neutrinos is typically much less than unity. We find that the most optimistic cases of the corona and hidden wind models could be consistent with the observation of IceCube-191001A, whereas jet models are unlikely to explain the multi-messenger observations.},

  abstract = {The diffuse neutrino flux measured in IceCube is comparable with the ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) flux, which has led to the concept of a unified origin of high-energy neutrino and UHECR backgrounds. We construct a generic unification model of sources to explain UHECR data at \$\textbackslash gtrsim 10\^\{19\}\$ eV, and high-energy neutrinos with energies that exceed \$\textbackslash sim100\$ TeV in the framework of photo-meson production processes, and provide general constraints on the source properties. A source environment with moderately efficient in-situ production of \$\textbackslash gtrsim 100\$ TeV neutrinos with an optical depth of \$0.1 \textbackslash lesssim \textbackslash tau\_\{p\textbackslash gamma\}\textbackslash lesssim 0.6\$ must be realized to accelerate cosmic rays to ultrahigh energies. The measured fluxes of cosmic rays and neutrinos set a bound on the source luminosity and its rate density. Although the results are rather general and applicable to unknown source population, among the proposed source candidates, low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs) could satisfy the requirements if the Lorentz bulk factor of plasma outflow and the equipartition parameters for cosmic rays and magnetic field are appropriately selected.},

  abstract = {Supermassive black hole (SMBH) coalescences are ubiquitous in the history of the Universe and often exhibit strong accretion activities and powerful jets. These SMBH mergers are also promising candidates for future gravitational wave detectors such as Laser Space Inteferometric Antenna (LISA). In this work, we consider neutrino counterpart emission originating from the jet-induced shocks. The physical picture is that relativistic jets launched after the merger will push forward inside the premerger disk wind material, and then they subsequently get collimated, leading to the formation of internal shocks, collimation shocks, forward shocks and reverse shocks. Cosmic rays can be accelerated in these sites and neutrinos are expected via the photomeson production process. We formulate the jet structures and relevant interactions therein, and then evaluate neutrino emission from each shock site. We find that month-to-year high-energy neutrino emission from the postmerger jet after the gravitational wave event is detectable by IceCube-Gen2 within approximately five to ten years of operation in optimistic cases where the cosmic-ray loading is sufficiently high and a mildly super-Eddington accretion is achieved. We also estimate the contribution of SMBH mergers to the diffuse neutrino intensity, and find that a significant fraction of the observed very high-energy (\$E\_\textbackslash nu\textbackslash gtrsim1\$ PeV) IceCube neutrinos could originate from them in the optimistic cases. In the future, such neutrino counterparts together with gravitational wave observations can be used in a multimessenger approach to elucidate in greater detail the evolution and the physical mechanism of SMBH mergers.},
