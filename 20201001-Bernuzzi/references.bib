  abstract = {In the context of neutron star mergers, we study the gravitational wave spectrum of the merger remnant using numerical relativity simulations. Postmerger spectra are characterized by a main peak frequency f2 related to the particular structure and dynamics of the remnant hot hypermassive neutron star. We show that f2 is correlated with the tidal coupling constant {$\kappa$}T2 that characterizes the binary tidal interactions during the late-inspiral merger. The relation f2({$\kappa$}T2) depends very weakly on the binary total mass, mass ratio, equation of state, and thermal effects. This observation opens up the possibility of developing a model of the gravitational spectrum of every merger unifying the late-inspiral and postmerger descriptions.},

  abstract = {The data analysis of the gravitational wave signals emitted by coalescing neutron star binaries requires the availability of an accurate analytical representation of the dynamics and waveforms of these systems. We propose an effective-one-body model that describes the general relativistic dynamics of neutron star binaries from the early inspiral up to the merger. Our effective-one-body model incorporates an enhanced attractive tidal potential motivated by recent analytical advances in the post-Newtonian and gravitational self-force description of relativistic tidal interactions. No fitting parameters are introduced for the description of tidal interaction in the late, strong-field dynamics. We compare the model energetics and the gravitational wave phasing with new high-resolution multiorbit numerical relativity simulations of equal-mass configurations with different equations of state. We find agreement within the uncertainty of the numerical data for all configurations. Our model is the first semianalytical model that captures the tidal amplification effects close to merger. It thereby provides the most accurate analytical representation of binary neutron star dynamics and waveforms currently available.},

  abstract = {Binary neutron star mergers observations are a unique way to constrain fundamental physics and astrophysics at the extreme. The interpretation of gravitational-wave events and their electromagnetic counterparts crucially relies on general-relativistic models of the merger remnants. Quantitative models can be obtained only by means of numerical relativity simulations in 3+1 dimensions including detailed input physics for the nuclear matter, electromagnetic and weak interactions. This review summarizes the current understanding of merger remnants focusing on some of the aspects that are relevant for multimessenger observations.},
