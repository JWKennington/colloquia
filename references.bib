  abstract = {We derive the predictions of quantum gravity with fakeons on the amplitudes and spectral indices of the scalar and tensor fluctuations in inflationary cosmology. The action is \$R+R\^\{2\}\$ plus the Weyl-squared term. The ghost is eliminated by turning it into a fakeon, that is to say a purely virtual particle. We work to the next-to-leading order of the expansion around the de Sitter background. The consistency of the approach puts a lower bound (\$ m\_\{\textbackslash chi \}{$>$}m\_\{\textbackslash phi \}/4\$) on the mass \$m\_\{\textbackslash chi \}\$ of the fakeon with respect to the mass \$m\_\{\textbackslash phi \}\$ of the inflaton. The tensor-to-scalar ratio \$r\$ is predicted within less than an order of magnitude (\$4/3},

In this letter we identify a simple physical origin for these polytopes, associated with an interesting (1+1)-dimensional causal structure in kinematic space, along with solutions to the wave equation in this kinematic "spacetime" with a natural positivity property. The notion of time evolution in this kinematic spacetime can be abstracted away to a certain "walk", associated with any acyclic quiver, remarkably yielding a finite cluster polytope for the case of Dynkin quivers. The \$\{\textbackslash cal A\}\_\{n\{-\}3\},\{\textbackslash cal B\}\_\{n\{-\}1\}/\{\textbackslash cal C\}\_\{n\{-\}1\}\$ and \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$ polytopes are the amplituhedra for \$n\$-point tree amplitudes, one-loop tadpole diagrams, and full integrand of one-loop amplitudes. We also introduce a polytope \$\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$, which chops the \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$ polytope in half along a symmetry plane, capturing one-loop amplitudes in a more efficient way.},

Postmerger spectra are characterized by a main peak frequency f2 related to the particular structure and dynamics of the remnant hot hypermassive neutron star.

The relation f2({$\kappa$}T2) depends very weakly on the binary total mass, mass ratio, equation of state, and thermal effects. This observation opens up the possibility of developing a model of the gravitational spectrum of every merger unifying the late-inspiral and postmerger descriptions.},

We propose an effective-one-body model that describes the general relativistic dynamics of neutron star binaries from the early inspiral up to the merger. Our effective-one-body model incorporates an enhanced attractive tidal potential motivated by recent analytical advances in the post-Newtonian and gravitational self-force description of relativistic tidal interactions. No fitting parameters are introduced for the description of tidal interaction in the late, strong-field dynamics. We compare the model energetics and the gravitational wave phasing with new high-resolution multiorbit numerical relativity simulations of equal-mass configurations with different equations of state. We find agreement within the uncertainty of the numerical data for all configurations. Our model is the first semianalytical model that captures the tidal amplification effects close to merger. It thereby provides the most accurate analytical representation of binary neutron star dynamics and waveforms currently available.},

  abstract = {Reducing measurement errors in multi-qubit quantum devices is critical for performing any quantum algorithm. Here we show how to mitigate measurement errors by a classical post-processing of the measured outcomes. Our techniques apply to any experiment where measurement outcomes are used for computing expected values of observables. Two error mitigation schemes are presented based on tensor product and correlated Markovian noise models. Error rates parameterizing these noise models can be extracted from the measurement calibration data using a simple formula. Error mitigation is achieved by applying the inverse noise matrix to a probability vector that represents the outcomes of a noisy measurement. The error mitigation overhead, including the the number of measurements and the cost of the classical post-processing, is exponential in \$\textbackslash epsilon n\$, where \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ is the maximum error rate and \$n\$ is the number of qubits. We report experimental demonstration of our error mitigation methods on IBM Quantum devices using stabilizer measurements for graph states with \$n\textbackslash le 12\$ qubits and entangled 20-qubit states generated by low-depth random Clifford circuits.},

Analyses of the asymptotic information flux as given by the entanglement entropy show that it follows the Hawking curve, indicating that information is destroyed in these models. Recently, motivated by developments in AdS/CFT, a semiclassical island rule for entropy has been proposed. We define and compute the island rule entropy for black hole formation and evaporation in the large-N RST model of dilaton gravity and show that, in contrast, it follows the unitary Page curve. The relation of these two observations, and interesting properties of the dilaton gravity island rule, are discussed.},

This paper gives an explicit description of soft hair in terms of soft gravitons or photons on the black hole horizon, and shows that complete information about their quantum state is stored on a holographic plate at the future boundary of the horizon. Charge conservation is used to give an infinite number of exact relations between the evaporation products of black holes which have different soft hair but are otherwise identical. It is further argued that soft hair which is spatially localized to much less than a Planck length cannot be excited in a physically realizable process, giving an effective number of soft degrees of freedom proportional to the horizon area in Planck units.},

Yet, because of the inherently fragile nature of the physical computing elements (qubits), achieving quantum advantages over classical computation requires extremely low error rates for qubit operations, as well as substantial~physical qubits, to realize fault tolerance via quantum error correction2,3. However, recent theoretical work4,5 has shown that the accuracy of computation (based on expectation values of quantum observables) can be enhanced through an extrapolation of results from a collection of experiments of varying noise. Here we demonstrate this error~mitigation protocol on a superconducting quantum processor, enhancing its computational capability, with no additional hardware modifications. We apply the protocol to mitigate errors in canonical single- and two-qubit experiments and then extend its application to the variational optimization6\textendash 8 of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and magnetism9. We effectively demonstrate that the suppression of incoherent errors helps to achieve an otherwise inaccessible level of accuracy in the variational solutions using our noisy processor. These results demonstrate that error mitigation techniques will enable substantial improvements in the capabilities of near-term quantum computing hardware.},

  abstract = {Wide\textendash band gap metal halide perovskites are promising semiconductors to pair with silicon in tandem solar cells to pursue the goal of achieving power conversion efficiency (PCE) greater than 30\% at low cost. However, wide\textendash band gap perovskite solar cells have been fundamentally limited by photoinduced phase segregation and low open-circuit voltage. We report efficient 1.67\textendash electron volt wide\textendash band gap perovskite top cells using triple-halide alloys (chlorine, bromine, iodine) to tailor the band gap and stabilize the semiconductor under illumination. We show a factor of 2 increase in photocarrier lifetime and charge-carrier mobility that resulted from enhancing the solubility of chlorine by replacing some of the iodine with bromine to shrink the lattice parameter. We observed a suppression of light-induced phase segregation in films even at 100-sun illumination intensity and less than 4\% degradation in semitransparent top cells after 1000 hours of maximum power point (MPP) operation at 60\textdegree C. By integrating these top cells with silicon bottom cells, we achieved a PCE of 27\% in two-terminal monolithic tandems with an area of 1 square centimeter.},

  author = {Zayas, Leopoldo A. Pando and Xin, Yu},

  abstract = {We numerically study the topologically twisted index of several three-dimensional supersymmetric field theories on a genus \$g\$ Riemann surface times a circle, \$\textbackslash Sigma\_g\textbackslash times S\^1\$. We show that for a large class of theories with leading term of the order \$N\^\{3/2\}\$, where \$N\$ is generically the rank of the gauge group, there is a universal logarithmic correction of the form \$\textbackslash frac\{g-1\}\{2\} \textbackslash log N\$. We explain how this logarithmic subleading correction can be obtained as a one-loop effect on the dual supergravity theory for magnetically charged, asymptotically AdS\$\_4\textbackslash times M\^7\$ black holes for a large class of Sasaki-Einstein manifolds, \$M\^7\$. The matching of the logarithmic correction relies on a generic cohomological property of \$M\^7\$ and it is independent of the black hole charges. We argue that our supergravity results apply also to rotating, electrically charged asymptotically AdS\$\_4\textbackslash times M\^7\$ black holes. We present explicitly the quiver gauge theories and the gravity side corresponding to \$M\^7=N\^\{0,1,0\}, V\^\{5,2\}\$ and \$Q\^\{1,1,1\}\$.},
