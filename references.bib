  abstract = {We derive the predictions of quantum gravity with fakeons on the amplitudes and spectral indices of the scalar and tensor fluctuations in inflationary cosmology. The action is \$R+R\^\{2\}\$ plus the Weyl-squared term. The ghost is eliminated by turning it into a fakeon, that is to say a purely virtual particle. We work to the next-to-leading order of the expansion around the de Sitter background. The consistency of the approach puts a lower bound (\$ m\_\{\textbackslash chi \}{$>$}m\_\{\textbackslash phi \}/4\$) on the mass \$m\_\{\textbackslash chi \}\$ of the fakeon with respect to the mass \$m\_\{\textbackslash phi \}\$ of the inflaton. The tensor-to-scalar ratio \$r\$ is predicted within less than an order of magnitude (\$4/3},

  abstract = {Perturbative scattering amplitudes in gauge theories have remarkable simplicity and hidden infinite dimensional symmetries that are completely obscured in the conventional formulation of field theory using Feynman diagrams. This suggests the existence of a new understanding for scattering amplitudes where locality and unitarity do not play a central role but are derived consequences from a different starting point. In this note we provide such an understanding for N = 4 SYM scattering amplitudes in the planar limit, which we identify as ``the volume'' of a new mathematical object \textemdash{} the Amplituhedron \textemdash generalizing the positive Grassmannian. Locality and unitarity emerge hand-in-hand from positive geometry.},

  abstract = {The "amplituhedron" for tree-level scattering amplitudes in the bi-adjoint \$\textbackslash phi\^3\$ theory is given by the ABHY associahedron in kinematic space, which has been generalized to give a realization for all finite-type cluster algebra polytopes, labelled by Dynkin diagrams. In this letter we identify a simple physical origin for these polytopes, associated with an interesting (1+1)-dimensional causal structure in kinematic space, along with solutions to the wave equation in this kinematic "spacetime" with a natural positivity property. The notion of time evolution in this kinematic spacetime can be abstracted away to a certain "walk", associated with any acyclic quiver, remarkably yielding a finite cluster polytope for the case of Dynkin quivers. The \$\{\textbackslash cal A\}\_\{n\{-\}3\},\{\textbackslash cal B\}\_\{n\{-\}1\}/\{\textbackslash cal C\}\_\{n\{-\}1\}\$ and \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$ polytopes are the amplituhedra for \$n\$-point tree amplitudes, one-loop tadpole diagrams, and full integrand of one-loop amplitudes. We also introduce a polytope \$\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$, which chops the \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$ polytope in half along a symmetry plane, capturing one-loop amplitudes in a more efficient way.},

  abstract = {"Over the last decade, several important advances have occurred, that include the continuum and classical limit of the non-perturbative theory on the conceptual side, and concrete ideas on confronting quantum gravity with observations in cosmology. This volume takes the reader from basics to recent advances, thereby bridging an important gap. It presents a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in loop quantum gravity from the perspective of young leading researchers. The goal is two-fold: to provide a contemporary introduction to the entire field for students and post-docs and, an overview of the current status for more senior researchers. These overviews present the latest developments that are not discussed in existing books, particularly the applications to the cosmology of the early universe and quantum aspects of black holes"--},
