  abstract = {We derive the predictions of quantum gravity with fakeons on the amplitudes and spectral indices of the scalar and tensor fluctuations in inflationary cosmology. The action is \$R+R\^\{2\}\$ plus the Weyl-squared term. The ghost is eliminated by turning it into a fakeon, that is to say a purely virtual particle. We work to the next-to-leading order of the expansion around the de Sitter background. The consistency of the approach puts a lower bound (\$ m\_\{\textbackslash chi \}{$>$}m\_\{\textbackslash phi \}/4\$) on the mass \$m\_\{\textbackslash chi \}\$ of the fakeon with respect to the mass \$m\_\{\textbackslash phi \}\$ of the inflaton. The tensor-to-scalar ratio \$r\$ is predicted within less than an order of magnitude (\$4/3},

  abstract = {Perturbative scattering amplitudes in gauge theories have remarkable simplicity and hidden infinite dimensional symmetries that are completely obscured in the conventional formulation of field theory using Feynman diagrams. This suggests the existence of a new understanding for scattering amplitudes where locality and unitarity do not play a central role but are derived consequences from a different starting point. In this note we provide such an understanding for N = 4 SYM scattering amplitudes in the planar limit, which we identify as ``the volume'' of a new mathematical object \textemdash{} the Amplituhedron \textemdash generalizing the positive Grassmannian. Locality and unitarity emerge hand-in-hand from positive geometry.},

  abstract = {The "amplituhedron" for tree-level scattering amplitudes in the bi-adjoint \$\textbackslash phi\^3\$ theory is given by the ABHY associahedron in kinematic space, which has been generalized to give a realization for all finite-type cluster algebra polytopes, labelled by Dynkin diagrams. In this letter we identify a simple physical origin for these polytopes, associated with an interesting (1+1)-dimensional causal structure in kinematic space, along with solutions to the wave equation in this kinematic "spacetime" with a natural positivity property. The notion of time evolution in this kinematic spacetime can be abstracted away to a certain "walk", associated with any acyclic quiver, remarkably yielding a finite cluster polytope for the case of Dynkin quivers. The \$\{\textbackslash cal A\}\_\{n\{-\}3\},\{\textbackslash cal B\}\_\{n\{-\}1\}/\{\textbackslash cal C\}\_\{n\{-\}1\}\$ and \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$ polytopes are the amplituhedra for \$n\$-point tree amplitudes, one-loop tadpole diagrams, and full integrand of one-loop amplitudes. We also introduce a polytope \$\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$, which chops the \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$ polytope in half along a symmetry plane, capturing one-loop amplitudes in a more efficient way.},

  abstract = {"Over the last decade, several important advances have occurred, that include the continuum and classical limit of the non-perturbative theory on the conceptual side, and concrete ideas on confronting quantum gravity with observations in cosmology. This volume takes the reader from basics to recent advances, thereby bridging an important gap. It presents a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in loop quantum gravity from the perspective of young leading researchers. The goal is two-fold: to provide a contemporary introduction to the entire field for students and post-docs and, an overview of the current status for more senior researchers. These overviews present the latest developments that are not discussed in existing books, particularly the applications to the cosmology of the early universe and quantum aspects of black holes"--},

  abstract = {In the context of neutron star mergers, we study the gravitational wave spectrum of the merger remnant using numerical relativity simulations. Postmerger spectra are characterized by a main peak frequency f2 related to the particular structure and dynamics of the remnant hot hypermassive neutron star. We show that f2 is correlated with the tidal coupling constant {$\kappa$}T2 that characterizes the binary tidal interactions during the late-inspiral merger. The relation f2({$\kappa$}T2) depends very weakly on the binary total mass, mass ratio, equation of state, and thermal effects. This observation opens up the possibility of developing a model of the gravitational spectrum of every merger unifying the late-inspiral and postmerger descriptions.},

  abstract = {The data analysis of the gravitational wave signals emitted by coalescing neutron star binaries requires the availability of an accurate analytical representation of the dynamics and waveforms of these systems. We propose an effective-one-body model that describes the general relativistic dynamics of neutron star binaries from the early inspiral up to the merger. Our effective-one-body model incorporates an enhanced attractive tidal potential motivated by recent analytical advances in the post-Newtonian and gravitational self-force description of relativistic tidal interactions. No fitting parameters are introduced for the description of tidal interaction in the late, strong-field dynamics. We compare the model energetics and the gravitational wave phasing with new high-resolution multiorbit numerical relativity simulations of equal-mass configurations with different equations of state. We find agreement within the uncertainty of the numerical data for all configurations. Our model is the first semianalytical model that captures the tidal amplification effects close to merger. It thereby provides the most accurate analytical representation of binary neutron star dynamics and waveforms currently available.},

  abstract = {Binary neutron star mergers observations are a unique way to constrain fundamental physics and astrophysics at the extreme. The interpretation of gravitational-wave events and their electromagnetic counterparts crucially relies on general-relativistic models of the merger remnants. Quantitative models can be obtained only by means of numerical relativity simulations in 3+1 dimensions including detailed input physics for the nuclear matter, electromagnetic and weak interactions. This review summarizes the current understanding of merger remnants focusing on some of the aspects that are relevant for multimessenger observations.},
