  abstract = {We derive the predictions of quantum gravity with fakeons on the amplitudes and spectral indices of the scalar and tensor fluctuations in inflationary cosmology. The action is \$R+R\^\{2\}\$ plus the Weyl-squared term. The ghost is eliminated by turning it into a fakeon, that is to say a purely virtual particle. We work to the next-to-leading order of the expansion around the de Sitter background. The consistency of the approach puts a lower bound (\$ m\_\{\textbackslash chi \}{$>$}m\_\{\textbackslash phi \}/4\$) on the mass \$m\_\{\textbackslash chi \}\$ of the fakeon with respect to the mass \$m\_\{\textbackslash phi \}\$ of the inflaton. The tensor-to-scalar ratio \$r\$ is predicted within less than an order of magnitude (\$4/3},

  abstract = {"Over the last decade, several important advances have occurred, that include the continuum and classical limit of the non-perturbative theory on the conceptual side, and concrete ideas on confronting quantum gravity with observations in cosmology. This volume takes the reader from basics to recent advances, thereby bridging an important gap. It presents a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in loop quantum gravity from the perspective of young leading researchers. The goal is two-fold: to provide a contemporary introduction to the entire field for students and post-docs and, an overview of the current status for more senior researchers. These overviews present the latest developments that are not discussed in existing books, particularly the applications to the cosmology of the early universe and quantum aspects of black holes"--},
