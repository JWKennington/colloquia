  abstract = {We derive the predictions of quantum gravity with fakeons on the amplitudes and spectral indices of the scalar and tensor fluctuations in inflationary cosmology. The action is \$R+R\^\{2\}\$ plus the Weyl-squared term. The ghost is eliminated by turning it into a fakeon, that is to say a purely virtual particle. We work to the next-to-leading order of the expansion around the de Sitter background. The consistency of the approach puts a lower bound (\$ m\_\{\textbackslash chi \}{$>$}m\_\{\textbackslash phi \}/4\$) on the mass \$m\_\{\textbackslash chi \}\$ of the fakeon with respect to the mass \$m\_\{\textbackslash phi \}\$ of the inflaton. The tensor-to-scalar ratio \$r\$ is predicted within less than an order of magnitude (\$4/3},

This suggests the existence of a new understanding for scattering amplitudes where locality and unitarity do not play a central role but are derived consequences from a different starting point. In this note we provide such an understanding for N = 4 SYM scattering amplitudes in the planar limit, which we identify as ``the volume'' of a new mathematical object \textemdash{} the Amplituhedron \textemdash generalizing the positive Grassmannian. Locality and unitarity emerge hand-in-hand from positive geometry.},

  abstract = {The "amplituhedron" for tree-level scattering amplitudes in the bi-adjoint \$\textbackslash phi\^3\$ theory is given by the ABHY associahedron in kinematic space, which has been generalized to give a realization for all finite-type cluster algebra polytopes, labelled by Dynkin diagrams. In this letter we identify a simple physical origin for these polytopes, associated with an interesting (1+1)-dimensional causal structure in kinematic space, along with solutions to the wave equation in this kinematic "spacetime" with a natural positivity property. The notion of time evolution in this kinematic spacetime can be abstracted away to a certain "walk", associated with any acyclic quiver, remarkably yielding a finite cluster polytope for the case of Dynkin quivers. The \$\{\textbackslash cal A\}\_\{n\{-\}3\},\{\textbackslash cal B\}\_\{n\{-\}1\}/\{\textbackslash cal C\}\_\{n\{-\}1\}\$ and \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$ polytopes are the amplituhedra for \$n\$-point tree amplitudes, one-loop tadpole diagrams, and full integrand of one-loop amplitudes. We also introduce a polytope \$\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$, which chops the \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$ polytope in half along a symmetry plane, capturing one-loop amplitudes in a more efficient way.},

The goal is two-fold: to provide a contemporary introduction to the entire field for students and post-docs and, an overview of the current status for more senior researchers.

Postmerger spectra are characterized by a main peak frequency f2 related to the particular structure and dynamics of the remnant hot hypermassive neutron star. We show that f2 is correlated with the tidal coupling constant {$\kappa$}T2 that characterizes the binary tidal interactions during the late-inspiral merger. The relation f2({$\kappa$}T2) depends very weakly on the binary total mass, mass ratio, equation of state, and thermal effects. This observation opens up the possibility of developing a model of the gravitational spectrum of every merger unifying the late-inspiral and postmerger descriptions.},

We propose an effective-one-body model that describes the general relativistic dynamics of neutron star binaries from the early inspiral up to the merger. Our effective-one-body model incorporates an enhanced attractive tidal potential motivated by recent analytical advances in the post-Newtonian and gravitational self-force description of relativistic tidal interactions. No fitting parameters are introduced for the description of tidal interaction in the late, strong-field dynamics. We compare the model energetics and the gravitational wave phasing with new high-resolution multiorbit numerical relativity simulations of equal-mass configurations with different equations of state. We find agreement within the uncertainty of the numerical data for all configurations. Our model is the first semianalytical model that captures the tidal amplification effects close to merger. It thereby provides the most accurate analytical representation of binary neutron star dynamics and waveforms currently available.},

So far, many of these efforts have been focusing on superconducting qubits, whose industrial progress is currently way ahead of all other qubit implementations. This paper briefly reviews the progress made on the silicon-based QC platform, which is highly promising to meet the scale-up challenges by leveraging the semiconductor industry. We look at different types of qubits, the advantages of silicon, and techniques for qubit manipulation in the solid state. Finally, we discuss the possibility of co-integrating silicon qubits with FET-based, cooled front-end electronics, and review the device physics of MOSFETs at deep cryogenic temperatures.},

  abstract = {Quantum computation, a completely different paradigm of computing, benefits from theoretically proven speed-ups for certain problems and opens up the possibility of exactly studying the properties of quantum systems. Yet, because of the inherent fragile nature of the physical computing elements, qubits, achieving quantum advantages over classical computation requires extremely low error rates for qubit operations as well as a significant overhead of physical qubits, in order to realize fault-tolerance via quantum error correction. However, recent theoretical work has shown that the accuracy of computation based off expectation values of quantum observables can be enhanced through an extrapolation of results from a collection of varying noisy experiments. Here, we demonstrate this error mitigation protocol on a superconducting quantum processor, enhancing its computational capability, with no additional hardware modifications. We apply the protocol to mitigate errors on canonical single- and two-qubit experiments and then extend its application to the variational optimization of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and magnetism. We effectively demonstrate that the suppression of incoherent errors helps unearth otherwise inaccessible accuracies to the variational solutions using our noisy processor. These results demonstrate that error mitigation techniques will be critical to significantly enhance the capabilities of near-term quantum computing hardware.},

We explain how this logarithmic subleading correction can be obtained as a one-loop effect on the dual supergravity theory for magnetically charged, asymptotically AdS\$\_4\textbackslash times M\^7\$ black holes for a large class of Sasaki-Einstein manifolds, \$M\^7\$. The matching of the logarithmic correction relies on a generic cohomological property of \$M\^7\$ and it is independent of the black hole charges.
