  abstract = {We derive the predictions of quantum gravity with fakeons on the amplitudes and spectral indices of the scalar and tensor fluctuations in inflationary cosmology. The action is \$R+R\^\{2\}\$ plus the Weyl-squared term. The ghost is eliminated by turning it into a fakeon, that is to say a purely virtual particle. We work to the next-to-leading order of the expansion around the de Sitter background. The consistency of the approach puts a lower bound (\$ m\_\{\textbackslash chi \}{$>$}m\_\{\textbackslash phi \}/4\$) on the mass \$m\_\{\textbackslash chi \}\$ of the fakeon with respect to the mass \$m\_\{\textbackslash phi \}\$ of the inflaton. The tensor-to-scalar ratio \$r\$ is predicted within less than an order of magnitude (\$4/3},

In this letter we identify a simple physical origin for these polytopes, associated with an interesting (1+1)-dimensional causal structure in kinematic space, along with solutions to the wave equation in this kinematic "spacetime" with a natural positivity property. The notion of time evolution in this kinematic spacetime can be abstracted away to a certain "walk", associated with any acyclic quiver, remarkably yielding a finite cluster polytope for the case of Dynkin quivers.

Our effective-one-body model incorporates an enhanced attractive tidal potential motivated by recent analytical advances in the post-Newtonian and gravitational self-force description of relativistic tidal interactions. No fitting parameters are introduced for the description of tidal interaction in the late, strong-field dynamics. We compare the model energetics and the gravitational wave phasing with new high-resolution multiorbit numerical relativity simulations of equal-mass configurations with different equations of state. We find agreement within the uncertainty of the numerical data for all configurations. Our model is the first semianalytical model that captures the tidal amplification effects close to merger. It thereby provides the most accurate analytical representation of binary neutron star dynamics and waveforms currently available.},

  abstract = {Reducing measurement errors in multi-qubit quantum devices is critical for performing any quantum algorithm. Here we show how to mitigate measurement errors by a classical post-processing of the measured outcomes. Our techniques apply to any experiment where measurement outcomes are used for computing expected values of observables. Two error mitigation schemes are presented based on tensor product and correlated Markovian noise models. Error rates parameterizing these noise models can be extracted from the measurement calibration data using a simple formula. Error mitigation is achieved by applying the inverse noise matrix to a probability vector that represents the outcomes of a noisy measurement. The error mitigation overhead, including the the number of measurements and the cost of the classical post-processing, is exponential in \$\textbackslash epsilon n\$, where \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ is the maximum error rate and \$n\$ is the number of qubits. We report experimental demonstration of our error mitigation methods on IBM Quantum devices using stabilizer measurements for graph states with \$n\textbackslash le 12\$ qubits and entangled 20-qubit states generated by low-depth random Clifford circuits.},

Recently, motivated by developments in AdS/CFT, a semiclassical island rule for entropy has been proposed. We define and compute the island rule entropy for black hole formation and evaporation in the large-N RST model of dilaton gravity and show that, in contrast, it follows the unitary Page curve.

This paper gives an explicit description of soft hair in terms of soft gravitons or photons on the black hole horizon, and shows that complete information about their quantum state is stored on a holographic plate at the future boundary of the horizon. Charge conservation is used to give an infinite number of exact relations between the evaporation products of black holes which have different soft hair but are otherwise identical. It is further argued that soft hair which is spatially localized to much less than a Planck length cannot be excited in a physically realizable process, giving an effective number of soft degrees of freedom proportional to the horizon area in Planck units.},

We report on the first direct in situ measurement of density fluctuations across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition. This allows us to introduce a general and straightforward way to extract the static structure factor, estimate the spectrum of elementary excitations and image the dominant fluctuation patterns. We observe a strong response in the static structure factor and infer a distinct roton minimum in the dispersion relation. Furthermore, we show that the characteristic fluctuations correspond to elementary excitations such as the roton modes, which have been theoretically predicted to be dominant at the quantum critical point, and that the supersolid state supports both superfluid as well as crystal phonons.},

Yet, because of the inherently fragile nature of the physical computing elements (qubits), achieving quantum advantages over classical computation requires extremely low error rates for qubit operations, as well as substantial~physical qubits, to realize fault tolerance via quantum error correction2,3. However, recent theoretical work4,5 has shown that the accuracy of computation (based on expectation values of quantum observables) can be enhanced through an extrapolation of results from a collection of experiments of varying noise. Here we demonstrate this error~mitigation protocol on a superconducting quantum processor, enhancing its computational capability, with no additional hardware modifications. We apply the protocol to mitigate errors in canonical single- and two-qubit experiments and then extend its application to the variational optimization6\textendash 8 of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and magnetism9. We effectively demonstrate that the suppression of incoherent errors helps to achieve an otherwise inaccessible level of accuracy in the variational solutions using our noisy processor. These results demonstrate that error mitigation techniques will enable substantial improvements in the capabilities of near-term quantum computing hardware.},

We present a comprehensive analysis of TXS0506+056 during its flaring state, using newly collected Swift, NuSTAR, and X-shooter data with Fermi observations and numerical models to constrain the blazar's particle acceleration processes and multimessenger (electromagnetic (EM) and high-energy neutrino) emissions. Accounting properly for EM cascades in the emission region, we find a physically consistent picture only within a hybrid leptonic scenario, with {$\gamma$}-rays produced by external inverseCompton processes and high-energy neutrinos via a radiatively subdominant hadronic component. We derive robust constraints on the blazar's neutrino and cosmic-ray emissions and demonstrate that, because of cascade effects, the 0.1\textendash 100 keV emissions of TXS0506+056 serve as a better probe of its hadronic acceleration and highenergy neutrino production processes than its GeV\textendash TeV emissions. If the IceCube neutrino association holds, physical conditions in the TXS0506+056 jet must be close to optimal for high-energy neutrino production, and are not favorable for ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray acceleration. Alternatively, the challenges we identify in generating a significant rate of IceCube neutrino detections from TXS0506+056 may disfavor single-zone models, in which {$\gamma$}-rays and high-energy neutrinos are produced in a single emission region. In concert with continued operations of the high-energy neutrino observatories, we advocate regular X-ray monitoring of TXS0506+056 and other blazars in order to test single-zone blazar emission models, clarify the nature and extent of their hadronic acceleration processes, and carry out the most sensitive possible search for additional multimessenger sources.},

We developed a stable perovskite solar cell with a bandgap of \textasciitilde 1.7 electron volts that retained more than 80\% of its initial PCE of 20.7\% after 1000 hours of continuous illumination. Anion engineering of phenethylammonium-based two-dimensional (2D) additives was critical for controlling the structural and electrical properties of the 2D passivation layers based on a lead iodide framework. The high PCE of 26.7\% of a monolithic two-terminal wide-bandgap perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell was made possible by the ideal combination of spectral responses of the top and bottom cells.},

  abstract = {Tidal disruption events (TDE) have been considered as cosmic-ray and neutrino sources for a decade. We suggest two classes of new scenarios for high-energy multi-messenger emission from TDEs that do not have to harbor powerful jets. First, we investigate high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray production in the core region of a supermassive black hole. In particular, we show that about 1-100 TeV neutrinos and MeV gamma-rays can efficiently be produced in hot coronae around an accretion disk. We also study the consequences of particle acceleration in radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). Second, we consider possible cosmic-ray acceleration by sub-relativistic disk-driven winds or interactions between tidal streams, and show that subsequent hadronuclear and photohadronic interactions inside the TDE debris lead to GeV-PeV neutrinos and sub-GeV cascade gamma-rays. We demonstrate that these models should be accompanied by soft gamma-rays or hard X-rays as well as optical/UV emission, which can be used for future observational tests. Although this work aims to present models of non-jetted high-energy emission, we discuss the implications of the TDE AT2019dsg that might coincide with the high-energy neutrino IceCube-191001A, by considering the corona, RIAF, hidden sub-relativistic wind, and hidden jet models. It is not yet possible to be conclusive about their physical association and the expected number of neutrinos is typically much less than unity. We find that the most optimistic cases of the corona and hidden wind models could be consistent with the observation of IceCube-191001A, whereas jet models are unlikely to explain the multi-messenger observations.},

This raises the possibility that quantum purity is restored by correlations between the hard and soft radiation, while inclusive measurements which omit the soft radiation observe the thermal Hawking spectrum. In theories whose only stable particle is the graviton, conservation laws are used to argue that such correlations are in principle sufficient for the soft gravitons to purify the hard thermal ones.},

However, wide\textendash band gap perovskite solar cells have been fundamentally limited by photoinduced phase segregation and low open-circuit voltage. We report efficient 1.67\textendash electron volt wide\textendash band gap perovskite top cells using triple-halide alloys (chlorine, bromine, iodine) to tailor the band gap and stabilize the semiconductor under illumination. We show a factor of 2 increase in photocarrier lifetime and charge-carrier mobility that resulted from enhancing the solubility of chlorine by replacing some of the iodine with bromine to shrink the lattice parameter. We observed a suppression of light-induced phase segregation in films even at 100-sun illumination intensity and less than 4\% degradation in semitransparent top cells after 1000 hours of maximum power point (MPP) operation at 60\textdegree C. By integrating these top cells with silicon bottom cells, we achieved a PCE of 27\% in two-terminal monolithic tandems with an area of 1 square centimeter.},

The measured fluxes of cosmic rays and neutrinos set a bound on the source luminosity and its rate density. Although the results are rather general and applicable to unknown source population, among the proposed source candidates, low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs) could satisfy the requirements if the Lorentz bulk factor of plasma outflow and the equipartition parameters for cosmic rays and magnetic field are appropriately selected.},

  abstract = {Supermassive black hole (SMBH) coalescences are ubiquitous in the history of the Universe and often exhibit strong accretion activities and powerful jets. These SMBH mergers are also promising candidates for future gravitational wave detectors such as Laser Space Inteferometric Antenna (LISA). In this work, we consider neutrino counterpart emission originating from the jet-induced shocks. The physical picture is that relativistic jets launched after the merger will push forward inside the premerger disk wind material, and then they subsequently get collimated, leading to the formation of internal shocks, collimation shocks, forward shocks and reverse shocks. Cosmic rays can be accelerated in these sites and neutrinos are expected via the photomeson production process. We formulate the jet structures and relevant interactions therein, and then evaluate neutrino emission from each shock site. We find that month-to-year high-energy neutrino emission from the postmerger jet after the gravitational wave event is detectable by IceCube-Gen2 within approximately five to ten years of operation in optimistic cases where the cosmic-ray loading is sufficiently high and a mildly super-Eddington accretion is achieved. We also estimate the contribution of SMBH mergers to the diffuse neutrino intensity, and find that a significant fraction of the observed very high-energy (\$E\_\textbackslash nu\textbackslash gtrsim1\$ PeV) IceCube neutrinos could originate from them in the optimistic cases. In the future, such neutrino counterparts together with gravitational wave observations can be used in a multimessenger approach to elucidate in greater detail the evolution and the physical mechanism of SMBH mergers.},
