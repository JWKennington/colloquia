  abstract = {Reducing measurement errors in multi-qubit quantum devices is critical for performing any quantum algorithm. Here we show how to mitigate measurement errors by a classical post-processing of the measured outcomes. Our techniques apply to any experiment where measurement outcomes are used for computing expected values of observables. Two error mitigation schemes are presented based on tensor product and correlated Markovian noise models. Error rates parameterizing these noise models can be extracted from the measurement calibration data using a simple formula. Error mitigation is achieved by applying the inverse noise matrix to a probability vector that represents the outcomes of a noisy measurement. The error mitigation overhead, including the the number of measurements and the cost of the classical post-processing, is exponential in \$\textbackslash epsilon n\$, where \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ is the maximum error rate and \$n\$ is the number of qubits. We report experimental demonstration of our error mitigation methods on IBM Quantum devices using stabilizer measurements for graph states with \$n\textbackslash le 12\$ qubits and entangled 20-qubit states generated by low-depth random Clifford circuits.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) has already entered the industrial landscape and several multinational corporations have initiated their own research efforts. So far, many of these efforts have been focusing on superconducting qubits, whose industrial progress is currently way ahead of all other qubit implementations. This paper briefly reviews the progress made on the silicon-based QC platform, which is highly promising to meet the scale-up challenges by leveraging the semiconductor industry. We look at different types of qubits, the advantages of silicon, and techniques for qubit manipulation in the solid state. Finally, we discuss the possibility of co-integrating silicon qubits with FET-based, cooled front-end electronics, and review the device physics of MOSFETs at deep cryogenic temperatures.},

  abstract = {Quantum computation, a paradigm of computing that is completely different from classical methods, benefits from theoretically proved speed-ups for certain problems and can be used to study the properties of quantum systems1. Yet, because of the inherently fragile nature of the physical computing elements (qubits), achieving quantum advantages over classical computation requires extremely low error rates for qubit operations, as well as substantial~physical qubits, to realize fault tolerance via quantum error correction2,3. However, recent theoretical work4,5 has shown that the accuracy of computation (based on expectation values of quantum observables) can be enhanced through an extrapolation of results from a collection of experiments of varying noise. Here we demonstrate this error~mitigation protocol on a superconducting quantum processor, enhancing its computational capability, with no additional hardware modifications. We apply the protocol to mitigate errors in canonical single- and two-qubit experiments and then extend its application to the variational optimization6\textendash 8 of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and magnetism9. We effectively demonstrate that the suppression of incoherent errors helps to achieve an otherwise inaccessible level of accuracy in the variational solutions using our noisy processor. These results demonstrate that error mitigation techniques will enable substantial improvements in the capabilities of near-term quantum computing hardware.},
