  abstract = {The SU (N f )L {$\otimes$} SU (N f )R chiral symmetry of QCD is of central importance for the nonperturbative low-energy dynamics of light quarks and gluons. Lattice field theory provides a theoretical framework in which these dynamics can be studied from first principles. The implementation of chiral symmetry on the lattice is a nontrivial issue. In particular, local lattice fermion actions with the chiral symmetry of the continuum theory suffer from the fermion doubling problem. The Ginsparg\textendash Wilson relation implies Lu\textasciidieresis scher's lattice variant of chiral symmetry which agrees with the usual one in the continuum limit. Local lattice fermion actions that obey the Ginsparg\textendash Wilson relation have an exact chiral symmetry, the correct axial anomaly, they obey a lattice version of the Atiyah\textendash Singer index theorem, and still they do not suffer from the notorious doubling problem. The Ginsparg\textendash Wilson relation is satisfied exactly by Neuberger's overlap fermions which are a limit of Kaplan's domain wall fermions, as well as by Hasenfratz and Niedermayer's classically perfect lattice fermion actions. When chiral symmetry is nonlinearly realized in effective field theories on the lattice, the doubling problem again does not arise. This review provides an introduction to chiral symmetry on the lattice with an emphasis on the basic theoretical framework.},

  abstract = {I show that a lattice theory of massive interacting fermions in 2n + 1 dimensions may be used to simulate the behaviour of massless chiral fermions in 2n dimensions if the fermion mass has a step function shape in the extra dimension. The massless states arise as zeromodes bound to the mass defect, and all doublers can be given large gauge invariant masses. The manner in which the anomalies are realized is transparent: apparent chiral anomalies in the 2n dimensional subspace correspond to charge flow into the extra dimension.},
