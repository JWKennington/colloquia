  abstract = {Engineered substrates offer a promising avenue towards graphene devices having tunable properties. In particular, topographically patterned substrates can expose unique behavior due to their ability to induce local variations in strain and electrostatic doping. However, to explore the range of possible science and applications, it is important to create topographic substrates which both have tunable features and are suitable for transport measurements. In this Letter we describe the fabrication of tunable, topographically patterned substrates suitable for transport measurements. We report both optical and transport measurements of graphene devices fabricated on these substrates, and demonstrate characteristic strain and local doping behavior induced by the topographic features.},

  abstract = {Spatially nonuniform strain is important for engineering the pseudomagnetic field and band structure of graphene. Despite the wide interest in strain engineering, there is still a lack of control on device-compatible strain patterns due to the limited understanding of the structure-strain relationship. Here, we study the effect of substrate corrugation and curvature on the strain profiles of graphene via combined experimental and theoretical studies of a model system: graphene on closely packed SiO2 nanospheres with different diameters (20-200 nm). Experimentally, via quantitative Raman analysis, we observe partial adhesion and wrinkle features and find that smaller nanospheres induce larger tensile strain in graphene; theoretically, molecular dynamics simulations confirm the same microscopic structure and size dependence of strain and reveal that a larger strain is caused by a stronger, inhomogeneous interaction force between smaller nanospheres and graphene. This molecular-level understanding of the strain mechanism is important for strain engineering of graphene and other two-dimensional materials.},
