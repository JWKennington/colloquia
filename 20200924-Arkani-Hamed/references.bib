  abstract = {The "amplituhedron" for tree-level scattering amplitudes in the bi-adjoint \$\textbackslash phi\^3\$ theory is given by the ABHY associahedron in kinematic space, which has been generalized to give a realization for all finite-type cluster algebra polytopes, labelled by Dynkin diagrams. In this letter we identify a simple physical origin for these polytopes, associated with an interesting (1+1)-dimensional causal structure in kinematic space, along with solutions to the wave equation in this kinematic "spacetime" with a natural positivity property. The notion of time evolution in this kinematic spacetime can be abstracted away to a certain "walk", associated with any acyclic quiver, remarkably yielding a finite cluster polytope for the case of Dynkin quivers. The \$\{\textbackslash cal A\}\_\{n\{-\}3\},\{\textbackslash cal B\}\_\{n\{-\}1\}/\{\textbackslash cal C\}\_\{n\{-\}1\}\$ and \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$ polytopes are the amplituhedra for \$n\$-point tree amplitudes, one-loop tadpole diagrams, and full integrand of one-loop amplitudes. We also introduce a polytope \$\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$, which chops the \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\_n\$ polytope in half along a symmetry plane, capturing one-loop amplitudes in a more efficient way.},
