  abstract = {The geometric properties of a lattice can have profound consequences on its band spectrum. For example, symmetry constraints and geometric frustration can give rise to topologicially nontrivial and dispersionless bands, respectively. Line-graph lattices are a perfect example of both of these features: their lowest energy bands are perfectly flat, and here we develop a formalism to connect some of their geometric properties with the presence or absence of fragile topology in their flat bands. This theoretical work will enable experimental studies of fragile topology in several types of line-graph lattices, most naturally suited to superconducting circuits.},

  abstract = {The axion insulator is a higher-order topological insulator protected by inversion symmetry. We show that under quenched disorder respecting inversion symmetry \{\textbackslash it on average\}, the topology of the axion insulator stays robust, and an intermediate metallic phase in which states are delocalized is unavoidable at the transition from an axion insulator to a trivial insulator. We derive this conclusion from general arguments, from classical percolation theory, and from the numerical study of a 3D quantum network model simulating a disordered axion insulator through a layer construction. We find the localization length critical exponent near the delocalization transition to be \$\textbackslash nu=1.42\textbackslash pm 0.12\$. We further show that this delocalization transition is stable even to weak breaking of the average inversion symmetry, up to a critical strength. We also quantitatively map our quantum network model to an effective Hamiltonian and we find its low energy k\$\textbackslash cdot\$p expansion.},

  abstract = {The discovery of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has unveiled a rich variety of superconducting, magnetic and topologically nontrivial phases. The existence of all these phases in one material, and their tunability, has opened new pathways for the creation of unusual gate tunable junctions. However, the required conditions for their creation - gate induced transitions between phases in zero magnetic field - have so far not been achieved. Here, we report on the first experimental demonstration of a device that is both a zero-field Chern insulator and a superconductor. The Chern insulator occurs near moire cell filling factor v = +1 in a hBN non-aligned MATBG device and manifests itself via an anomalous Hall effect. The insulator has Chern number C = +-1 and a relatively high Curie temperature of Tc = 4.5 K. Gate tuning away from this state exposes strong superconducting phases with critical temperatures of up to Tc = 3.5 K. In a perpendicular magnetic field above B {$>$} 0.5 T we observe a transition of the /C/= +1 Chern insulator from Chern number C = +-1 to C = 3, characterized by a quantized Hall plateau with Ryx = h/3e2. These observations show that interaction-induced symmetry breaking in MATBG leads to zero-field ground states that include almost degenerate and closely competing Chern insulators, and that states with larger Chern numbers couple most strongly to the B-field. By providing the first demonstration of a system that allows gate-induced transitions between magnetic and superconducting phases, our observations mark a major milestone in the creation of a new generation of quantum electronics.},

  abstract = {Topological insulators realized in materials with strong spin-orbit interactions challenged the long-held view that electronic materials are classified as either conductors or insulators. The emergence of controlled, two-dimensional moire patterns has opened new vistas in the topological materials landscape. Here we report on evidence, obtained by combining thermodynamic measurements, local and non-local transport measurements, and theoretical calculations, that robust topologically non-trivial, valley Chern insulators occur at charge neutrality in twisted double-bilayer graphene (TDBG). These time reversal-conserving valley Chern insulators are enabled by valley-number conservation, a symmetry that emerges from the moir\textbackslash 'e pattern. The thermodynamic gap extracted from chemical potential measurements proves that TDBG is a bulk insulator under transverse electric field, while transport measurements confirm the existence of conducting edge states. A Landauer-Buttiker analysis of measurements on multi-terminal samples allows us to quantitatively assess edge state scattering and demonstrate that it does not destroy the edge states, leaving the bulk-boundary correspondence largely intact.},

  abstract = {We present a two-step method specifically tailored for band structure calculation of the small-angle moir\textbackslash '\{e\}-pattern materials which contain tens of thousands of atoms in a unit cell. In the first step, the self-consistent field calculation for ground state is performed with \$O(N)\$ Krylov subspace method implemented in OpenMX. Secondly, the crystal momentum dependent Bloch Hamiltonian and overlap matrix are constructed from the results obtained in the first step and only a small number of eigenvalues near the Fermi energy are solved with shift-invert and Lanczos techniques. By systematically tuning two key parameters, the cutoff radius for electron hopping interaction and the dimension of Krylov subspace, we obtained the band structures for both rigid and corrugated twisted bilayer graphene structures at the first magic angle (\$\textbackslash theta=1.08\^\textbackslash circ\$) and other three larger ones with satisfied accuracy on affordable costs. The band structures are in good agreement with those from tight binding models, continuum models, plane-wave pseudo-potential based \$ab\textasciitilde initio\$ calculations, and the experimental observations. This efficient two-step method is to play a crucial role in other twisted two-dimensional materials, where the band structures are much more complex than graphene and the effective model is hard to be constructed.},
